Kal is a self-hosted, open-source, serverless CLI-based email newsletter app.

Kal exposes a public REST API to manage subscribers, enabling you to set up custom frontends (e.g., subscribe forms) or other automation.

You can write and send emails using the CLI from any machine (Windows / Linux / Mac OS).

### Why do you call it Kal?

It's named after Kaladin from [the Stormlight Archive](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49075-the-stormlight-archive),
who is one of my favorite fictional characters.
I think it goes well as a name for a CLI too.
